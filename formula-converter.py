# Write a program that calculates the result using the following formula:

# result
# =
# 3
# �
# +
# 5
# �
# result=3x+5y
# You are required to write the code to convert the formula above to Python.

# Assume that we have x and y variables already defined:
x = int(input("Enter x value: "))
y = int(input("Enter y value: "))
# You are required to use the above variables to calculate
# the value of result
result = 3 * x + 5 * y
print(result)
